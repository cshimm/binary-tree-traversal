Approach:
In order to make the testing process as transparent as possible
I decided to create a test tree that was based off of the sample
tree from the slides. 
In order to make assertions I decided that instead of printing the visited
node, I would append the nodes value to an array and compare that 
array to an expected array. 
Challenges:
Implementing levelorder traversal was hard to understand at first given 
the many different moving parts that are needed to implement it.
